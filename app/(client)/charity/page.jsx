            We focus on the Tharparkar region in Pakistan, one of the most food
            deprived communities in the world. Droughts and famines occur
            regularly in Tharparkar, which makes growing food and accessing
            clean water incredibly difficult. Most of the people who live in
            this region hardly ever manage to eat 2 meals a day. Every year,
            1,500 children die due to malnutrition. Facing such extreme
            challenges, Penny Appeal asks you to help. By simply donating Â£1 you
            will provide a meal to those who need it most.

          The issue of hunger in Pakistan is complex and multifaceted,
          influenced by factors such as poverty, limited access to education and
          healthcare, and natural disasters. Addressing this pervasive problem
          requires collective action and a comprehensive approach. By
          implementing sustainable solutions, promoting agricultural
          development, empowering communities, and fostering partnerships, we
          can make a significant impact in alleviating hunger and creating a
          brighter future for all Pakistanis."
